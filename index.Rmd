Hi! I'm Salomé Carcy, a PhD student in the [Meyer lab](https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/) at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/). I study how the development of different T cell lineages is regulated in the human thymus. I'm actually a medical student from France, so after my PhD I'll go back to medical school in Paris and start clinical rotations. Don't ask what I would like to specialize in, because I don't know yet!

Outside lab or the hospital, I like to:

- get involved in affinity groups: I volunteered in the past in [ARES](https://www.facebook.com/areslillecatho/) at the [medical school](https://fmms.fr/) of the Université Catholique de Lille to inform, encourage and accompany young medical students who would like to get involved in science; I also volunteered for two years in [DIAS](https://www.cshl.edu/research/career-development/dias/) at CSHL to promote and advocate for more diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM.
- write scientific articles for the general public: you can find an article about [senescence and telomeropathies](https://planet-vie.ens.fr/thematiques/sante/pathologies/telomeres-et-telomeropathies#:~:text=Les%20t%C3%A9lom%C3%A9ropathies%20forment%20un%20spectre,partie%20de%20l'ADN%20codant.) or about the [Human Impacts Database](https://planet-vie.ens.fr/thematiques/ecologie/human-impacts-database-la-base-de-donnees-recensant-l-impact-de-l-etre-humain)
- read graphic novels: my favorite is probably [Vie De Carabin](https://twitter.com/VieDeCarabin), a doctor telling stories from his experience at the hospital.
